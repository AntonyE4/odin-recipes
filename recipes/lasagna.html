        <h3><b>Zucchini Lasagna</b> is a fresh, new take on a comfort dish loved by many across the world.</h3> 
        
        <p>While different from the usual Pasta bake, the dish still thrives with fantastic flavours, brought together with <em>healthier</em> ingredients and a more veggie-conscious take on the classic meal.</p>

        <p>The star of the show, the Zucchini, is such a versatile vegetable, capable of fitting into almost anything that a dish requires, such as Noodles or Bread. It's so fitting, you'll <b>barely</b> even notice it's there! It'll taste just like Mama used to make.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 Large Zucchini</li>
            <li>2lbs Ground Beef</li>
            <li>24oz Pasta Sauce</li>
            <li>15oz Ricotta Cheese, 1 cup Shredded Parmesan & 1/2cup Mozzarella</li>
            <li>1 Egg</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper (to taste)</li>
            <li>Small handful of Fresh Parsley and Basil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Slice zucchini.</b> Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Slice the zucchini lengthwise into thin slices, as thin or thick as you'd like. Set aside.</li>
            <li><b>Make bolognese.</b> Add the ground beef to a large pan over medium-high heat. Finely break down the ground beef with a spatula and pan-fry until browned and no longer pink. Then, pour the pasta sauce on top (remember to reserve 1/2 cup) and stir together, then remove from heat.</li>
            <li><b>Make ricotta mix.</b> In a medium bowl, make the ricotta mix by stirring together the ricotta cheese, parmesan, egg, salt and pepper.</li>
            <li><b>Add the first layers.</b> Spread 1/2 cup of pasta sauce onto the bottom of your 9×13-inch casserole dish. Then add your zucchini slices on top of the pasta sauce. They can overlap or you can place them side-by-side.</li>
            <li><b>Add the secondary layers.</b> Top the zucchini with 1/2 of the bolognese sauce, and evenly spread 1/2 the ricotta mix on top of that. Then, add 1/2 cup of grated mozzarella with a sprinkle of chopped parsley and basil. </li>
            <li><b>Repeat</b> these layers one more time.</li>
            <li><b>Finish the topping.</b> Top the lasagna with a final layer of zucchini slices, a sprinkle of chopped parsley and basil, and 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li><b>Bake.</b> Place the lasagna in the oven and cook for 40 to 45 minutes. Broil for a couple of minutes to get a nice golden top. Garnish with whole basil leaves and serve.</li>
        </ol>
