       <h3><b>Ribollita is one of Tuscanyâ€™s many famous bread soups.</b></h3>

       <p>While typically known as a "poor" or "peasant" dish, Ribollita is capable of becoming something greater than the sum of its parts. Long-lasting, nourishing and absolutely delicious, this cheap soup will have you reheating <b>over and over</b> again.</p>

       <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <h3>Canellini Beans</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>5 1/3oz of Cannelini Beans (soaked cold overnight)</li>
            <li>1/2 an Onion, peeled and cut in half</li>
            <li>4 Garlic Cloves, unpeeled and bashed</li>
            <li>2 Bay Leaves, 2 Sprigs of Thyme and Salt</li>
         </ul>
        
         <h3>Ribollita</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li>3 1/2oz of Stale Bread, torn into rough 3cm chunks</li>
            <li>1tsp Fennel seeds</li>
            <li>1 pinch of Chilli Flakes</li>
            <li>1 diced Onion</li>
            <li>1 Carrot, peeled and diced into 1cm cubes</li>
            <li>2 Celery sticks, sliced</li>
            <li>3 Garlic cloves, diced</li>
            <li>3 Plum tomatoes, quartered</li>
            <li>2 Medium potatoes, peeled and cut into sixths</li>
            <li>3 Cavolo nero leaves, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>2 Savoy cabbage leaves, sliced</li>
            <li>1 Bay leaf, 1 sprig of rosemary and thyme, salt and pepper</li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Steps:</h3>
         <ol>
            <li><b>Cook the cannellini beans</b> in a pan of salted water with the onion, garlic, bay, thyme and a healthy pinch of salt for 45 minutes, or until just undercooked. Drain and reserve the cooking water. Discard the onion, garlic and herbs</li>
            <li><b>Add a splash of olive oil</b> to a large, heavy-bottomed pan over a medium heat. Gently sweat the onion, garlic, carrot and celery with the herbs, chilli flakes, fennel and a pinch of salt until soft but without colour (about 10 minutes)</li>
            <li><b>Add the tomatoes</b> and stir for a couple of minutes. Add the beans and reserved bean stock, topping up with water as needed. Simmer for 30 minutes</li>
            <li><b>After this time</b>, add the potato, cavolo nero, savoy cabbage and bread and simmer for a further 15 minutes, or until the potato is cooked. Taste and season with salt and pepper</li>
            <li><b>For best results</b>, chill the soup after cooking and reheat the next day. Serve with a generous drizzle of good quality extra virgin olive oil and freshly cracked black pepper</li>
         </ol>
